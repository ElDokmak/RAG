            "Review: Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\n",

The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others.

The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn\\'t fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn\\'t suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn\\'t enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\\n\\n: 129\\nReview_Date: 20 August 2023\\nAuthor: Leofwine_draca\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A real mixed bag\\nReview: BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It\\'s very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it\\'s deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film\\'s skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it\\'s a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9209060/?ref_=tt_urv\\n\\n: 29\\nReview_Date: 21 November 2023\\nAuthor: sandy777\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Some humorous moments, but the story fell flat\\nReview: Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn\\'t care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn\\'t seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9209060/?ref_=tt_urv', name='PublicReviews'), AIMessage(content=\"Based on the public reviews of the Barbie movie, it seems that the reception is mixed.

The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn\\'t fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn\\'t suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn\\'t enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\\n\\n: 129\\nReview_Date: 20 August 2023\\nAuthor: Leofwine_draca\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A real mixed bag\\nReview: BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It\\'s very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it\\'s deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film\\'s skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it\\'s a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9209060/?ref_=tt_urv\\n\\n: 29\\nReview_Date: 21 November 2023\\nAuthor: sandy777\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Some humorous moments, but the story fell flat\\nReview: Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn\\'t care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn\\'t seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9209060/?ref_=tt_urv', name='PublicReviews'), AIMessage(content=\"Based on the public reviews of the Barbie movie, it seems that the reception is mixed.
