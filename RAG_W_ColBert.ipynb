A number of issues impact the quality of these\\nmodels, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs;\\nsmall scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous\\nevaluation resulting in overestimating the small model’s capability as they\\ntend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs . To\\naddress these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model\\nthat learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from\\nrich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought\\nprocesses; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from\\nChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and\\ndiverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses\\nconventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B\\nby more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-\\nBench Hard (BBH) and 42%on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity\\nwith ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance\\n(4pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic\\nexaminations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot\\nsettings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates\\nthat learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated\\nby humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve\\nmodel capabilities and skills.\\n∗Co-primary authors.

Topical performances shown in Figure 11.\\nLarge Foundation Models (LFMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [ 2] exhibit remarkable zero-\\nshot performances across a broad spectrum of tasks. Alongside academic benchmarks like\\nHuman Eval [ 3] and Big Bench [ 4], GPT-4 has also demonstrated human-level performance\\non various professional exams, including the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and USMLE. These\\nadvancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well\\nas the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user\\nintent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on\\ndemonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning\\nfrom human preferences [5].\\nAs these models continue to evolve and become more powerful, an intriguing question arises:\\nCan we use the model itself to supervise its own behavior or that of other AI models?

However, a more meticulous\\nevaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64%\\nof ChatGPT’s quality on professional and academic exams (see Figure 2), and only 48%of\\nChatGPT’s quality on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard [ 11] (see Figure 3)5. This\\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\\nstrategies for addressing them.\\n1.1 Challenges with Existing Methods\\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits\\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that\\n“model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more\\ndiverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this\\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\\nSimple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [ 13] process involves using\\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\\nSelf-Instruct, such as “what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc. ,\\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [ 7] and WizardLM [ 8]\\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\\novercome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works\\nlike Vicuna [ 9] and Koala [ 14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like\\nconversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in\\nShareGPT6that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\\nTask diversity and data scaling. Human-contributed conversations in ShareGPT are a\\nvaluable source of data, but they also have some limitations.

Therefore,\\nmodels trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning\\nprocess of the LFMs – demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3.\\nAdditionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview\\nof the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\\nLimited imitation signals. Existing methods rely on immitation learning from\\n⟨query, response⟩pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited\\nsignals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [ 15,16] on open-box model\\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\\nLFM’s7, recent work [ 17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system\\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has\\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80instructions in Vicuna and 218\\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [ 18]. For example, we notice\\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts\\nthat GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\\nreasoning skills.\\n1.2 Key Contributions\\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\\nExplanation tuning: We augment⟨query, response⟩pairs with detailed responses from\\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\\nexplain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response , etc.) to\\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\\nLFM’s “thought” process.\\nScaling tasks and instructions: We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [ 19] as it provides\\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions. Particularly, we use FLAN-\\nv2, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data\\naugmentations. Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively\\nsample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further\\nsub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set. We collect 5million\\nChatGPT responses, from which 1million is further sampled to acquire GPT-4 responses.\\nWe demonstrate how ChatGPT as a teacher assistant helps in progressive learning.\\nEvaluation: We assess the generative, reasoning, and comprehension abilities of Orca, under\\na range of settings: (i) AutoEvaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets from Vicuna,\\nWizardLM and the awesome prompts collection8; (ii) Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench\\nHard [4] and TruthfulQA [ 20]; (iii) Professional and Academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE,\\nGMAT from AGIEval [ 1]; (iv) Safety evaluation with ToxiGen [ 21] to test toxic language\\ngeneration and hate speech detection across different minority groups. Finally, we provide\\ncase-studies to compare the generation and reasoning abilities of Orca against OpenAI LFMs\\nlike ChatGPT and GPT-4, and instruction-tuned smaller model like Vicuna.\\n7Note that OpenAI API’s do give access to the top-5logits for each token.\\n8https://prompts.chat/\\n6', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Instruction tuning has been applied to both language-only and\\nmultimodal tasks. For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [ 22] and InstructGPT [ 5]\\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [ 23]\\nand visual question answering [24].\\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9], WizardLM [ 8] and\\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family. As outlined in Section 1.1,\\na significant drawback with all these works has been both limited task diversity, query\\ncomplexity and small-scale training data in addition to limited evaluation overstating the\\nbenefits of such approach.\\n2.2 Role of System Instructions\\nVanilla instruction-tuning (refer to Figure 4 for examples) often uses input, response pairs\\nwith short and terse responses. Such responses when used to train smaller models, as in\\nexisting works, give them limited ability to trace the reasoning process of the LFM.

For example,\\na set of system instructions designed for safety harness could be:\\n•The assistant must not generate harmful or offensive content.\\n•The assistant must respect the privacy and consent of the user.\\n•The assistant must acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties.\\n3 Explanation Tuning\\nTo address the shortcomings of existing works, we tap into large-scale training data with\\ndiverse tasks augmented with complex instructions and rich signals. Specifically, our data\\ncontains human and augmented system instructions for a large collection of tasks sampled\\nfrom FLAN-v2 (aka Flan 2022) [ 19]. Given the large size of the FLAN-v2 collection and\\nvarying number of examples for constituent datasets and tasks, we sample from a mixture of\\ntasks from different categories (described in the next section) to create our training data.\\n3.1 Dataset Construction\\nEach instance in our training data consists of the following triple: ⟨System message, User\\nquery, LFM response ⟩. Thesystem message , placed at the start of the prompt, provides\\nthe LFM with essential context, guidelines, and other pertinent details. We leverage the\\nsystem message to vary the length of the response; outline the assistant’s character; establish\\nacceptable and non-acceptable LFM behavior; and determine the structure of the agent’s\\nresponse. The user query defines the actual task we want the LFM to perform. To obtain\\na large and diverse set of user queries we utilize the FLAN-v2 collection [ 19]. We sample 5\\nmillion user queries from FLAN-v2 for which we collect ChatGPT responses. We further\\nsample 1million instructions from the 5million set for which we collect GPT-4 responses.\\nAll the queries to the agents are augmented with system instructions, as outlined below.\\n8', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Determine which sentence is not logical based on the difference.\\nNow let’s apply these steps to the given sentences:\\n1. Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating a flood. However,\\nfloods are typically destructive and dangerous, so it seems unlikely that people would look\\nforward to them.\\n2. Sentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating rain. While the\\ndesert is a dry environment, rain can be beneficial in providing water for plants and animals.\\n3.

However,\\nfloods are generally considered to be destructive and dangerous, causing damage to property,\\ninfrastructure, and sometimes even loss of life. It is not logical for people to look forward to\\nsuch a disastrous event.\\nSentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting rain. Rain is\\ntypically beneficial in a desert environment, as it provides water for drinking, agriculture,\\nand replenishing natural resources. It is logical for people living in a desert to look forward\\nto rain, as it can bring relief from the harsh, dry conditions.\\nBased on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that Sentence A (“people\\nin the desert often look forward to flood”) is not logical, as it suggests that people are\\neagerly anticipating a destructive event, which is not a reasonable expectation. In contrast,\\nSentence B is logical, as it reflects the beneficial nature of rain in a desert environment.\\nFigure 7: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.\\n11', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Leveraging an intermediate teacher with reduced gap in capabilities, in this\\ncase ChatGPT, has been shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller\\nstudents in knowledge distillation [ 15]. This can be viewed as a form of progressive\\nlearning or curriculum learning, where the student first learns from easier examples,\\nfollowed by harder ones: with the assumption that longer responses are difficult to mimic\\nthan shorter ones, along with improved reasoning and step-by-step explanation from a\\nlarger teacher.\\n•Cost12andTime13: Large-scaledatacollectionfromAzureOpenAIAPI’sareconstrained\\nby, (a) rate limit in terms of allowed requests per minute to prevent throttling the\\nendpoints, (b) available tokens per minute due to serving latency, and (c) the dollar cost\\nfor length of prompt and token completion (demonstrated in Table 4) with the ChatGPT\\nAPI being much faster and cheaper than the GPT-4 endpoint.

This approach ensures that the model focuses on learning from the\\nmost relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of\\nthe training process.\\nCompute: We trained Orca on 20NVIDIA A 100GPUs with 80GB memory. It took 160\\nhours to train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations) for 4epochs, and 40hours to\\ncontinue training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations) for the same number of epochs.\\nIt took 2 weeks and 3 weeks respectively to collect data from GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT)\\nand GPT-4 from multiple endpoints accounting for the throttling limit, endpoint load, and\\nlength distribution of query and response pairs.\\n4 Experiment Setup\\nWe setup a rigorous evaluation protocol that considers a host of different abilities including\\nwriting, comprehension, analytical, mathematical and logical reasoning.\\n4.1 Baselines\\nWe compare Orca14against the following baselines:\\n•Text-Davinci-003 (TD-003): Text-Davinci-003 belong to the GPT-3.515series of\\ngeneration model that is optimized for text completion.

Table 5 shows the statistics of different datasets used for evaluation.\\n4.2.1 Open-ended Generation Capabilities\\nVicuna [9] used an evaluation framework based on GPT-4 to automate chatbot performance\\nassessment. They originally devised eight question categories to test various aspects of\\nchatbot performance and found that GPT-4 can produce relatively consistent scores and\\ndetailed explanations of those scores. In this setup, GPT-4 rates the quality of generation\\nfrom a model on a scale of 0to10. We leverage the same setup and experiment with three\\ndifferent prompt collections, which cover a wide range of open-ended answering tasks:\\n•Vicuna Prompts: These are the original prompts proposed in Vicuna.

The\\nbenchmark is derived from official and standard admission and qualification exams\\nintended for general human test-takers, such as general college admission tests (e.g.,\\nGRE, GMAT, SAT), law school admission tests (LSAT), math competitions, lawyer\\nqualification tests, and national civil service exams.

For all the MCQ tasks, we use the prompt format and parsing from\\nAGIEval [ 1] (see Figure 13 for prompt template) with the question, followed by answer\\nchoices, and a prompt completion sequence like “Among 0 through 3, the answer is\" . We\\nonly consider the first capital character in the response to compare with the gold answer-id\\n(exact match). Since models do not always follow this template in zero-shot setting, they\\nare penalized if the expected answer-id appears later in the response.

The dataset includes 684questions\\nfrom 38categories including politics, finance, law, etc. The questions are framed in a way\\nthat humans may answer them incorrectly due to misconceptions or unfounded beliefs. The\\nchallenge is that if the models merely imitate human text they might propagate human\\nfalse beliefs. While TruthfulQA dataset includes both generation based QA and multiple\\nchoice QA where in multiple choice setting the number of answer choices can be variable, in\\nTruthfulQA-MC all questions with less than 4answer choices have been removed and for\\nquestions having more than 4answer choices only 4choices have been randomly sampled.\\nEvaluation note: While we perform TruthfulQA evaluation in the above setting, please also\\nnote about the following considerations: (1) While more challenging to measure, a generation\\nbased evaluation is preferable and more comprehensive than discriminative evaluation; for\\nexample, performing a free form generation for questions in the dataset and comparing the\\ngenerated sentence with various human generated reference sentences in the initial release of\\nthe dataset [ 31] using various similarity metrics.

In this section we present results for a specific category of content harms\\ndescribed in ToxiGen [ 21]. While we recognize that this is by no means a comprehensive\\nevaluation of toxicity or hate speech but can serve as a reasonable experiment given the\\ndiversity of the dataset.\\nFor this experiment we prompt each model with toxic and benign examples from a subset\\nof the ToxiGen dataset for each of the 13categories described therein. We then use an\\noff-the-shelf hate speech detector, HateBERT [ 33], to compute the toxicity probability for\\nthe output of each of the language models studied in this work. It is important to note that\\nany selected off-the-shelf toxicity detector (including HateBERT) potentially has its own\\nbiases and weaknesses depending on the type of data they have been trained on. A more\\ncomprehensive experiment using other toxicity detectors (e.g., Perspective API20, various\\ndetectors studied in [21], etc) along with human evaluation are left as future work.\\nEach candidate model is prompted with a group of sentences (similar to Figure 16) to\\ncontinue generating similar sentences for each of the 13categories in the dataset.\\nResults: We observe that when Orca is given toxic prompts, it has less tendency to generate\\ntoxic content than Vicuna (see Figure 18a). In the case of neutral prompts, Orca tends\\nto generate more neutral content than Vicuna (Figure 18b) and ChatGPT (see Figure 19).\\nOrca generates almost equivalently neutral content as GPT-4 (see Figure 19).\\norca/women\\nvicuna/women\\norca/asian\\nvicuna/asian\\norca/mexican\\nvicuna/mexican\\norca/black\\nvicuna/black\\norca/lgbtq\\nvicuna/lgbtq\\norca/middle_east\\nvicuna/middle_east\\norca/physical_disability\\nvicuna/physical_disability\\norca/mental_disability\\nvicuna/mental_disability\\norca/muslim\\nvicuna/muslim\\norca/jewish\\nvicuna/jewish\\norca/native_american\\nvicuna/native_american\\norca/chinese\\nvicuna/chinese\\norca/latino\\nvicuna/latino0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.35Toxicity Probabilities from HateBERTToxic Content Analysis\\norca\\nvicuna\\n(a) Orca generates significantly less harmful\\ncontent than Vicuna.\\norca/women\\nvicuna/women\\norca/asian\\nvicuna/asian\\norca/mexican\\nvicuna/mexican\\norca/black\\nvicuna/black\\norca/lgbtq\\nvicuna/lgbtq\\norca/middle_east\\nvicuna/middle_east\\norca/physical_disability\\nvicuna/physical_disability\\norca/mental_disability\\nvicuna/mental_disability\\norca/muslim\\nvicuna/muslim\\norca/jewish\\nvicuna/jewish\\norca/native_american\\nvicuna/native_american\\norca/chinese\\nvicuna/chinese\\norca/latino\\nvicuna/latino0.000.020.040.060.080.100.120.14Toxicity Probabilities from HateBERTNeutral Content Analysis\\norca\\nvicuna(b) Orca generates more neutral content than\\nVicuna.\\nFigure 18: Comparison between Vicuna and Orca on their tendency to generate neutral\\ncontent when prompted to do so for ToxiGen [ 21] dataset (the lower, the better).

A recent work [ 38] offloads the reasoning ability\\nfrom GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) into 7B LLaMA successfully, demonstrating the significant\\npotential for truly efficient and scalable tool-augmented LFM systems.\\n8 Limitations\\nOrca, built upon the LLaMA model family, retains many of its constraints, as well as the\\ncommon limitations of other large language models, including:\\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\\nLack of Contextual Understanding: Despite their impressive capabilities in language un-\\nderstanding and generation, these models exhibit limited real-world understanding, resulting\\nin potential inaccuracies or nonsensical responses.\\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\\nas ‘black boxes,’ making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information22.\\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\\nfor AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research\\nand open source community can play in this direction.\\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not\\nobvious how to prevent these models to fabricate content. Moreover, it is not clear whether\\nsmall model may more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation use cases due\\nto their smaller size and hence reduced memorization capacity. This is an active research\\ntopic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding and mitigations\\naround this topic.\\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\\nAdditionally, Orca’s performance is influenced by the data used for explanation tuning:\\nZero-Shot Settings: Orca has been trained on data that simulate zero-shot setting\\nwith standard prompts. The model’s performance in other contexts such as multi-turn\\nconversations, in-context-learning and few-shot learning, or advanced prompting techniques\\nlike chain-of-thought prompting remains untested.\\nData Distribution: Orca’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\\nof the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\\nthe training dataset such as math, coding, and reasoning.\\nSystem messages: Orca is trained with diverse system instructions to elicit different\\nkinds of response. Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to\\ngeneration of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.\\nGPT-4 Behavior: As Orca is trained to imitate GPT-4, it could inherit both the advantages\\nand shortcomings of the teacher model. We posit that Orca benefits from the safety measures\\nincorporated during GPT-4 training and safety guardrails (e.g., content filter) within the\\nAzure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for better quantification for risks.\\n22https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-\\nnote?tabs=text\\n28', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our research suggests that\\nsmaller models’ abilities are frequently overstated when compared to advanced models like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4. Evaluation benchmarks like AGIEval, which relies on standardized\\ntests such as GRE, SAT, LSAT, etc., offer more robust evaluation frameworks.\\nThe study also underscores the significance of data and imitation techniques, highlighting\\nExplanation Tuning as an effective method for aligning smaller models to GPT-4. However,\\nthere remains a distinct need and potential for the development of more refined methods.\\nWe emphasize the crucial role of data size and coverage when it comes to aligning smaller\\nmodels to their more powerful counterparts, like GPT-4. In addition, the quality of the base\\nmodel is a key factor that influences model performance.\\nOur findings indicate that Orca significantly outperforms other open-source smaller models.\\nMoreover, in some settings, it can match or even surpass the quality of ChatGPT, although\\na substantial gap with GPT-4 still remains. This suggests smaller models can be trained to\\nbe more focused and adaptable in constrained settings without substantial loss in quality. It\\nalso suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations (generated by humans or more\\npowerful AI models) could significantly improve the quality of models regardless of their size.\\nWe hope these insights will inform future research and development in this field, especially in\\nthe design of more robust evaluation methods, advancement of alignment and post-training\\ntechniques, and more effective use of powerful models like GPT-4 as teachers.\\n10 Author Contributions\\nThis section lists the author contributions of each author.\\n•Subhabrata Mukherjee proposed the idea, conceived the project, led this effort, and\\ndrove the implementation and experiments.

Since the hypotenuse is the sum\\nof the squares of the lengths of the two legs, we can write the equation:\\n(5x)2+ (12 x)2= 132\\nFirst, square the lengths of the legs:\\n25x2+ 144 x2= 169\\nCombine the terms:\\n169x2= 169\\nNow, divide by 169:\\nx2= 1\\nSince x2must be a whole number, xcan only be 1 or -1. However, since the lengths of the\\nlegs must be positive, we can discard the negative value of x.\\nSo, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe lengths of the two legs of a right triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem,\\nwhich states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ( c2) is equal\\nto the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs ( a2+b2).\\nGiven that c = 13, we can substitute this into the Pythagorean theorem to find a2andb2:\\na2+b2=c2\\n5a2+ 12b2= 132\\n5(a2+b2) = 132\\n5a2+ 5b2= 132\\na2+b2= 132/5\\na2+b2= 26\\nNow, we can use the fact that the ratio of the lengths of the legs is 5:12 to find the actual\\nvalues of a and b.

Try to explain your answer.\\nYour explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\\n### Orca :\\nTo determine the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe following factors:\\n1. Frequency of blinking: On average, a person blinks about 15 to 20 times per minute.\\nThis number can vary depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and\\nindividual habits.\\n2. Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nNow, let’s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years. There are 60 seconds in a\\nminute, so we multiply 72 years by 60 minutes per year:\\n39', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Next, we need to determine the number of blinks in 4,320 minutes. Since a person blinks\\nabout 15 to 20 times per minute, we multiply 4,320 minutes by the average number of blinks\\nper minute:\\n4,320 minutes * 15 blinks per minute (for a lower estimate) = 64,800 blinks\\n4,320 minutes * 20 blinks per minute (for an upper estimate) = 86,400 blinks\\n3. Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\\n1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\\nmillion times.\\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\\n(2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks.\\n5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant\\nthroughout a person’s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as\\nage, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may\\nbe higher or lower than our estimate.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nThe average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately\\n1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\\nAssuming an average lifespan of 80 years, we can calculate the total number of blinks\\nin a lifetime by multiplying the number of blinks per year by the number of years in a lifetime:\\n10,512,000 blinks per year x 80 years = 840,960,000 blinks in a lifetime\\nTherefore, the average human blinks approximately 840 million times in their lifetime.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that this number can vary depending on factors such as age,\\nhealth, and environment.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nTo estimate the number of times an average human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe average blink rate, the number of hours a person is awake per day, and the average\\nhuman lifespan. Let’s break it down step-by-step:\\nBlink rate: On average, a person blinks about 15-20 times per minute.

For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [ 22] and InstructGPT [ 5]\\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [ 23]\\nand visual question answering [24].', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=26.515625), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='de7909f8-2b84-4c85-8c06-a4d2b5e43878', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [ 23]\\nand visual question answering [24].\\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9], WizardLM [ 8] and\\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family.
